# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **DATA PROJECT 2024: DO INTERENATIONAL WORKERS IN DENMARK REMEDY LABOR SHORTAGE?** and is about the labor shortage inn Denmark. We investigate the development in labor shortage in different sectors and industries as well as the development in international workers in Dennmark. Thus, our analysis looks at how international labor can and does help remedy the huge labor shortage issue.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

LBESK03 (*source: DST*)
KBS2 (*source: DST*)
BARO3 (*source: DST*)
KBYG33 (*source: DST*)
International Labor.json (*source: jobindsats.dk*)


**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi``
``pip install pandas-datareader``

In this exam, we have used AI as an additional tool, co-pilot and ChatGPT. We have mainly used it as inspiration when we have been a little uncertain about our own approach.
