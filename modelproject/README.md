# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **THE TRANSITION TO ZERO-PROFITS IN COURNOT AND BERTRAND: FROM DUOPOLY TO OLIGOPOLY** and is about exploring the strategic interactions and equilibrium outcomes in duopoly and oligopoly markets using the Cournot and Bertrand models. The project includes both analytical and numerical analyses to delve into the complexities of firm behavior under different forms of competition.

The results of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installation:
''pip install ipywidgets''

In this project, we have used AI as an additional tool, co-pilot and ChatGPT. We have used it as an inspiration source to come up with approached to solve problems and ways to create code with. We have mainly done this when being a little unsure about our own approach.
