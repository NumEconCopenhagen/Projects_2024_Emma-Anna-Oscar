# Inaugural project

The results of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

In this exam, we have used AI as an additional tool, co-pilot and ChatGPT. We have mainly used it as inspiration when we have been a little uncertain about our own approach.
