This contains the exam set for "Introduction to Programming and Numerical analysis" and has been completed from 22/06-24/06 2024 by the three group members

Our exam project has solved the following problem sets:

- Problem 1: Production economy and CO2 taxation

- Problem 2: Career choice model

- Problem 3: Barecentric Interpolation

In this exam, we have used AI as an additional tool, co-pilot and ChatGPT. We have used it as an inspiration source to come up with approached to solve problems and ways to create code with. We have mainly done this when being a little unsure about our own approach.
