1. Inaugural project: "Exchange economy with two consumers and two goods".

2. Data project: "Do international workers in Denmark remedy labor shortage?". We fetch data from Danmarks Statistik and Jobindsats.dk (the databank from the Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment) on the labor shortage and employment in different sectors in Denmark, as well as the number of international workers. We show that there is potential for the international workers in Denmark to make a huge differencce for the labor shortage.

3. Model project: "The transition to zero-profts in Cournot and Bertrand: From duopoly to oligopoly". We model a Cournot and Bertrand duopoly, comparing the two models using given parameters. The project solves both models analytically and numerically. Our further analysis centers around the extension of the duopolies into oligopolies, investigating how profits converge to zero when the number of firms in the market increases.
